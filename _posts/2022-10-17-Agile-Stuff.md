### Weekly Struggles
- API ISSUES: The API wasn't functional for a while and we didn't know why. Then Gene and Caleb realized they were just running it wrong and fixed it.
- Makeing the ChessBoard interactive: Tried adding onclick events to the chessboard. At first it looked like it worked but the function ran too early and then it didn't work at all. Now we have a new idea on how to do it after some googling that we will implement soon.
